# Diabetes Prediction

## 📌 Overview
Diabetes Prediction is a machine learning project designed to **predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on health metrics**.  
This system uses real-world medical data to train a model that can classify whether a person is at risk of diabetes. The goal is to support early screening and awareness, especially for users without medical backgrounds.

## 🚀 Key Features
- ✅ Predicts diabetes risk based on input features such as glucose, BMI, age, etc.
- 📈 Uses machine learning models for accurate classification
- 🧠 Data preprocessing including cleaning, scaling, and validation
- 📊 Visualizations for insights and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** — Core language
- **Pandas, NumPy** — Data manipulation
- **Scikit-Learn** — Machine learning modeling
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** — Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** — Project development and demo

## 🧪 Machine Learning Workflow
1. Load and explore dataset
2. Preprocess data (clean missing values, scale features)
3. Train classification models
4. Evaluate performance using accuracy and validation
5. Generate prediction interface
